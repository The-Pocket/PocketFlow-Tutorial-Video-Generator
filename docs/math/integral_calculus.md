## **Introduction: The Promise - From Slices to Totals**

You have seen the symbols and heard the terms: the integral `∫`, the antiderivative, the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**, **u-substitution**, and **integration by parts**. These are not just abstract topics; they are the tools for calculating accumulation and finding a total—from the area under a curve to the total distance traveled by a vehicle.

In the previous tutorial, we mastered differential calculus, the science of finding an instantaneous rate of change (the slope). Now, we tackle its inverse: integral calculus, the science of summing up continuous change to find a total (the area).

**The Promise:** In the next 40 minutes, you will not just learn these concepts; you will understand them from the ground up. We will start with the simple, intuitive problem of finding the area under a curve and build our entire toolkit from there.

This table is the core of integral calculus. By the end of this tutorial, you will have the skills to solve every integral on this list.

## **Section 1: Building Intuition - The Area Under a Curve is Just a Sum**

#### The Big Picture
Before learning any formal rules, we will solve the central problem of integral calculus: finding the exact area under a curve. We will use the most intuitive method possible—slicing the area into simple rectangles and adding them up. This process, known as a **Riemann Sum**, is the foundation of integration. It demonstrates that the integral is, at its heart, just a summation.

#### The Motivating Problem
Find the exact area of the region bounded by the function `f(x) = x²`, the x-axis, and the vertical lines `x=0` and `x=1`. We cannot use a simple `Area = length × width` formula because the top boundary is curved.

Our strategy is to approximate this curved area with a shape we *can* measure: a rectangle.

#### The Slicing Strategy: Approximating with Rectangles
We will slice the interval from 0 to 1 into `n` equal sub-intervals. Each sub-interval will be the base of a rectangle whose height is determined by the function's value.

**Step 1: A Crude Approximation (n=1)**
*   We use a single rectangle for the entire interval.
*   **Width (`Δx`):** `(1 - 0) / 1 = 1`.
*   **Height:** We'll use the function's value at the right endpoint, `x=1`. Height = `f(1) = 1² = 1`.
*   **Area:** `1 × 1 = 1`.
This is a very poor overestimate of the true area.

**Step 2: A Better Approximation (n=4)**
*   We slice the interval into four rectangles.
*   **Width (`Δx`):** `(1 - 0) / 4 = 0.25`.
*   The right endpoints are at `x = 0.25`, `0.5`, `0.75`, and `1.0`.
*   The heights are `f(0.25)`, `f(0.5)`, `f(0.75)`, and `f(1.0)`.
*   **Total Area = Sum of individual rectangle areas:**
    `Area ≈ Δx * f(0.25) + Δx * f(0.5) + Δx * f(0.75) + Δx * f(1.0)`
    `Area ≈ 0.25 * (0.25²) + 0.25 * (0.5²) + 0.25 * (0.75²) + 0.25 * (1.0²)`
    `Area ≈ 0.25 * (0.0625 + 0.25 + 0.5625 + 1.0)`
    `Area ≈ 0.25 * (1.875) = 0.46875`
This is a much better approximation, though still an overestimate.

**Step 3: The Squeeze - Approaching the True Area**
The pattern is clear: as we increase `n`, the number of rectangles, our approximation becomes more accurate because the "error" area (the part of the rectangles above the curve) shrinks.

Let's observe this convergence in a table.

| Number of Rectangles (`n`) | Width of Each Rectangle (`Δx`) | Approximated Area (Sum) |
| :------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :----------------------: |
| 1                          |              1.0              |          1.00000         |
| 4                          |              0.25             |          0.46875         |
| 10                         |              0.1              |          0.38500         |
| 100                        |              0.01             |          0.33835         |
| 1,000                      |              0.001            |          0.33383         |
| 10,000                     |             0.0001            |          0.33338         |

The sum is undeniably approaching a single value: **1/3**. As `n` approaches infinity, the sum of the areas of these infinitely thin rectangles gives us the *exact* area under the curve.

#### Formalization: The Definite Integral
This entire process of taking the limit of a sum of slices is what we call **the definite integral**.

**The Formula:**
`∫ₐᵇ f(x)dx = lim (n→∞) Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ f(xᵢ)Δx`

This is the formal definition of the definite integral. It looks complex, but we have just performed every single step of it.

| Component         | Meaning                                                                    | In Our Example (`∫₀¹ x² dx`)                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `∫`               | **Integral Sign.** An elongated "S," standing for "sum."                     | The operation we are performing.                               |
| `ₐᵇ`               | **Limits of Integration.** The start (`a`) and end (`b`) of our interval.      | From `a=0` to `b=1`.                                           |
| `f(x)`            | **Integrand.** The function that determines the height of each slice.        | `f(x) = x²`.                                                   |
| `dx`              | **Differential.** Represents the infinitesimal width of each rectangle (`Δx`). | The width of our slices.                                       |
| `lim (n→∞) Σ ...` | **The Limit of the Sum.** The formal process we just explored with our table.  | The value our sum approached as `n` got larger: `1/3`.         |

Using this definition is powerful for understanding, but calculating the limit every time is incredibly slow. In the next section, we will learn the spectacular shortcut that makes integral calculus practical.

## **Section 2: The Grand Shortcut - The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC)**

#### The Big Picture
In the last section, we found the area under `y = x²` by calculating the limit of a Riemann Sum. This method is crucial for understanding what an integral *is*, but it is computationally slow and impractical.

The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC)** provides a spectacular shortcut. It establishes a deep and surprising connection between the two main branches of calculus:
*   **Differential Calculus:** The study of the instantaneous rate of change (slope).
*   **Integral Calculus:** The study of the total accumulation (area).

The FTC states that these two concepts are inverse operations. This relationship allows us to solve area problems with astonishing ease.

#### The Motivating Problem
Our goal is the same: find the exact area under `f(x) = x²` from `x=0` to `x=1`. This time, we will do it in three lines, without any limits or infinite sums.

#### The Core Idea: The Antiderivative
The key to the FTC is the concept of the **antiderivative**.

An antiderivative of a function `f(x)` is a new function, `F(x)`, whose derivative is `f(x)`. That is, `F'(x) = f(x)`.

Let's find the antiderivative for our function, `f(x) = x²`. We need to ask:
**"What function, `F(x)`, when I take its derivative, gives me `x²`?"**

We know the Power Rule for derivatives: `d/dx(xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹`. To reverse this, we must *add* one to the exponent and *divide* by the new exponent.

*   Start with `x²`.
*   Add 1 to the exponent: `x³`.
*   Differentiate `x³` to check: `d/dx(x³) = 3x²`. This is close, but we have an unwanted `3`.
*   To cancel the `3`, we must divide by `3`.
*   Let's try `F(x) = (1/3)x³`.
*   Check the derivative: `d/dx((1/3)x³) = (1/3) * 3x² = x²`. This is correct.

So, the antiderivative of `f(x) = x²` is `F(x) = (1/3)x³`.

#### The Formula: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2
The theorem states that if `F(x)` is an antiderivative of `f(x)`, then the definite integral of `f(x)` from `a` to `b` is simply the change in `F(x)` between those points.

**The Formula:**
`∫ₐᵇ f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)`

We often use the notation `[F(x)]ₐᵇ` to represent `F(b) - F(a)`.

This formula is the engine of integral calculus. It turns a complex area problem into simple arithmetic.

#### Step-by-Step Example: Solving Our Problem
**Problem:** Find the exact value of `∫₀¹ x² dx`.

1.  **Find the Antiderivative.**
    As we found above, the antiderivative of `f(x) = x²` is `F(x) = (1/3)x³`.

2.  **Evaluate the Antiderivative at the Limits of Integration (`b=1` and `a=0`).**
    *   `F(1) = (1/3)(1)³ = 1/3`
    *   `F(0) = (1/3)(0)³ = 0`

3.  **Subtract.**
    `Area = F(1) - F(0) = 1/3 - 0 = 1/3`.

This is the exact answer. It confirms the value our Riemann sum was slowly converging to. What took a complex limit calculation, we have now solved with basic algebra.

#### Connecting to Reality: Velocity and Distance
The FTC has a direct physical meaning.
*   Let `v(t)` be the velocity of a car at time `t`.
*   Let `s(t)` be the position of the car at time `t`.

We know from differential calculus that velocity is the derivative of position, so `s'(t) = v(t)`. This means that the position function `s(t)` is the **antiderivative** of the velocity function `v(t)`.

According to the FTC, the integral of velocity from time `a` to time `b` is:
`∫ₐᵇ v(t)dt = s(b) - s(a)`

*   `∫ₐᵇ v(t)dt` represents the **area under the velocity curve**.
*   `s(b) - s(a)` is the change in position, or the **total distance traveled**.

The FTC shows that these two concepts are identical. The integral is a tool for calculating total accumulation. To use it effectively, we need to be able to find antiderivatives quickly. That is the subject of the next section.

## **Section 3: Your First Toolkit - Essential Antiderivative Patterns**

#### The Big Picture
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus has transformed our area problem into an "find the antiderivative" problem. Our ability to solve integrals now depends on our ability to reverse the process of differentiation.

This section is dedicated to building our core library of antiderivatives. For every basic derivative rule you learned, there is a corresponding integration rule. We will focus on the most common patterns you will encounter.

#### The Indefinite Integral and the Constant of Integration `+ C`
When we find an antiderivative without limits of integration, it's called an **indefinite integral**. For example, `∫x² dx`.

There's a subtle detail here.
*   The derivative of `(1/3)x³` is `x²`.
*   The derivative of `(1/3)x³ + 5` is also `x²` (since the derivative of a constant is 0).
*   The derivative of `(1/3)x³ - 100` is also `x²`.

The antiderivative is not a single function, but a whole *family* of functions that differ by a constant. To represent this, we always add `+ C` (the constant of integration) to our answer for any indefinite integral.

`∫x² dx = (1/3)x³ + C`

When you evaluate a **definite integral** (like `∫₀¹ x² dx`), the `C` cancels out:
`F(b) + C - (F(a) + C) = F(b) - F(a)`.
So, you only need to include `+ C` for indefinite integrals.

#### The Antiderivative Table: Your Core Toolkit

This table contains the essential patterns. For each one, you can verify the result by taking the derivative of the right-hand side.

| Function `f(x)`             | Antiderivative `F(x) = ∫f(x)dx`          | Rule Name / Notes                                     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `k` (constant)              | `kx + C`                                 | e.g., `∫7 dx = 7x + C`                                  |
| `xⁿ` (for `n ≠ -1`)           | `(xⁿ⁺¹)/(n+1) + C`                         | **The Reverse Power Rule**                            |
| `x⁻¹` or `1/x`              | `ln|x| + C`                                | The exception to the Power Rule. Use absolute value.  |
| `eˣ`                        | `eˣ + C`                                 | The function is its own antiderivative.               |
| `aˣ`                        | `aˣ / ln(a) + C`                         | e.g., `∫2ˣ dx = 2ˣ / ln(2) + C`                         |
| `cos(x)`                    | `sin(x) + C`                             |                                                       |
| `sin(x)`                    | `-cos(x) + C`                            | **Watch the sign change.** `d/dx(-cos(x)) = -(-sin(x)) = sin(x)` |
| `sec²(x)`                   | `tan(x) + C`                             | Reverse of `d/dx(tan(x))`                           |
| `1 / (1 + x²)`              | `arctan(x) + C`                          | Reverse of `d/dx(arctan(x))`                        |
| `1 / √(1 - x²)`             | `arcsin(x) + C`                          | Reverse of `d/dx(arcsin(x))`                        |

#### Basic Integration Properties
Just like with derivatives, we can break integrals apart.

*   **Constant Multiple Rule:** `∫c * f(x)dx = c * ∫f(x)dx`
    You can pull a constant multiplier out in front of the integral.
    *   **Example:** `∫5x³ dx = 5 * ∫x³ dx = 5 * (x⁴/4) + C = (5/4)x⁴ + C`

*   **Sum/Difference Rule:** `∫(f(x) ± g(x))dx = ∫f(x)dx ± ∫g(x)dx`
    You can integrate a function term by term.
    *   **Example:** Find `∫(cos(x) - 4x)dx`.
        1.  Split it: `∫cos(x)dx - ∫4x dx`
        2.  Integrate the first term: `sin(x)`
        3.  Integrate the second term: `4 * ∫x¹ dx = 4 * (x²/2) = 2x²`
        4.  Combine and add `C`: `sin(x) - 2x² + C`

#### Putting It All Together: A Complete Example
**Problem:** Evaluate the definite integral `∫₁² (3x² + 4/x) dx`.

1.  **Find the indefinite integral first, term by term.**
    *   `∫(3x² + 4/x)dx = ∫3x² dx + ∫(4/x) dx`
    *   `= 3∫x² dx + 4∫(1/x) dx`
    *   `= 3(x³/3) + 4(ln|x|)`
    *   The antiderivative `F(x)` is `x³ + 4ln|x|`. (We can drop the `+ C` for definite integrals).

2.  **Apply the FTC: `F(2) - F(1)`**
    *   `F(2) = (2)³ + 4ln(2) = 8 + 4ln(2)`
    *   `F(1) = (1)³ + 4ln(1) = 1 + 4(0) = 1`

3.  **Calculate the result.**
    *   `Area = (8 + 4ln(2)) - 1 = 7 + 4ln(2)`
    *   This is the exact area. As a decimal, it's approximately `7 + 4(0.693) ≈ 9.772`.

This toolkit allows us to solve a wide range of integrals. However, it does not work for composite functions like `∫cos(5x)dx`. For that, we need our most powerful technique, which is the subject of the next section.

## **Section 4: The Master Technique - u-Substitution (The Reverse Chain Rule)**

#### The Big Picture
Our current toolkit works for simple functions, but it fails on **composite functions**—functions nested inside other functions. For example, how do we solve `∫cos(x²) * 2x dx`? None of our basic patterns apply.

This integral was likely created by using the Chain Rule for differentiation. **u-Substitution** is the technique for reversing the Chain Rule. It is the single most important and widely used integration technique. The strategy is to simplify a complex integral by changing the variable of integration from `x` to a new variable, `u`.

#### The Motivating Problem
Let's try to solve `∫cos(x²) * 2x dx`.
We notice a key feature: the integrand contains a function (`x²`) and its derivative (`2x`). This is the primary indicator that u-substitution will work.

#### The Algorithm: A Change of Variables

The process is a methodical 5-step procedure.

1.  **Choose `u`:** Identify the "inner function." A good choice for `u` is the part of the integrand that is inside another function (e.g., inside a parenthesis, under a square root, or in an exponent).
    *   For `∫cos(x²) * 2x dx`, the inner function is `x²`.
    *   Let `u = x²`.

2.  **Find `du`:** Differentiate your choice of `u` with respect to `x`.
    *   `du/dx = 2x`
    *   Now, solve for `du` algebraically: `du = 2x dx`.

3.  **Substitute:** Replace every expression involving `x` in the original integral with its equivalent in terms of `u`.
    *   Our integral is `∫cos(x²) * 2x dx`.
    *   Replace `x²` with `u`.
    *   Replace the entire `2x dx` term with `du`.
    *   The integral transforms from `∫cos(x²) * 2x dx` into `∫cos(u) du`.

4.  **Integrate:** Solve the new, simpler integral with respect to `u`.
    *   `∫cos(u) du = sin(u) + C`.
    *   This is an integral from our basic toolkit.

5.  **Back-substitute:** The original problem was in terms of `x`, so our answer must be too. Replace `u` with its original definition.
    *   Since `u = x²`, our final answer is `sin(x²) + C`.

You can always check your answer by differentiating it. Using the Chain Rule, `d/dx(sin(x²) + C) = cos(x²) * 2x`, which matches our original integrand.

#### Example 2: When the Derivative Isn't a Perfect Match
**Problem:** `∫x³(x⁴ + 5)⁶ dx`

1.  **Choose `u`:** The inner function is `x⁴ + 5`. Let `u = x⁴ + 5`.
2.  **Find `du`:** `du/dx = 4x³`, so `du = 4x³ dx`.
3.  **Substitute:** Our integral has `x³ dx`, but our `du` is `4x³ dx`. This is not a problem. We can solve for `x³ dx`:
    *   `x³ dx = (1/4)du`
    *   Now substitute: `∫(x⁴ + 5)⁶ * x³ dx` becomes `∫u⁶ * (1/4)du`.

4.  **Integrate:** Pull the constant out and use the Reverse Power Rule.
    *   `(1/4)∫u⁶ du = (1/4) * (u⁷/7) + C = u⁷/28 + C`.

5.  **Back-substitute:** Replace `u` with `x⁴ + 5`.
    *   Final answer: `(1/28)(x⁴ + 5)⁷ + C`.

#### u-Substitution with Definite Integrals
When dealing with definite integrals, you have two options:
1.  Solve the indefinite integral first, back-substitute to `x`, then use the original `x` limits.
2.  **(Better Method)** Convert the limits of integration from `x`-values to `u`-values. This avoids the back-substitution step entirely.

**Problem:** `∫₀¹ e⁵ˣ⁺¹ dx`

1.  **Choose `u` and find `du`:**
    *   `u = 5x + 1`
    *   `du = 5 dx`, so `dx = (1/5)du`.

2.  **Change the Limits:**
    *   **Lower Limit:** When `x = 0`, `u = 5(0) + 1 = 1`.
    *   **Upper Limit:** When `x = 1`, `u = 5(1) + 1 = 6`.

3.  **Substitute Everything:** The integral transforms completely.
    *   `∫₀¹ e⁵ˣ⁺¹ dx` becomes `∫₁⁶ eᵘ * (1/5)du`.

4.  **Integrate with the New `u` Limits:**
    *   `(1/5)∫₁⁶ eᵘ du = (1/5)[eᵘ]₁⁶`
    *   `= (1/5)(e⁶ - e¹)`

This is the final, exact answer. There is no need to go back to `x`. Mastering u-substitution is the key to unlocking a vast range of integration problems.

## **Section 5: Integration by Parts (The Reverse Product Rule)**

#### The Big Picture
We have mastered u-substitution, which reverses the Chain Rule. But how do we integrate a function that was likely created using the Product Rule?

#### The Motivating Problem
Consider the integral `∫x * cos(x) dx`.
This is a product of two unrelated functions, `x` and `cos(x)`. Let's analyze why our existing tools fail:
*   **Basic Patterns:** This doesn't match any of our simple antiderivative forms.
*   **u-Substitution:** If we choose `u = x`, then `du = dx`, which doesn't help simplify `cos(x)`. If we choose `u = cos(x)`, then `du = -sin(x) dx`, which doesn't help us deal with the `x` term. We are stuck.

We need a new technique. This technique, **Integration by Parts**, is specifically designed to handle these products by reversing the Product Rule for differentiation.

#### Deriving the Formula
The formula comes directly from the Product Rule:
1.  **Product Rule:** `d/dx(uv) = u(dv/dx) + v(du/dx)`
2.  **Integrate both sides:** `∫(d/dx(uv))dx = ∫u dv + ∫v du`
3.  **Simplify and rearrange:** `uv = ∫u dv + ∫v du`

This gives us the standard formula. The core idea is to transform one integral into another.

**The Formula for Integration by Parts:**
`∫u dv = uv - ∫v du`

Our goal is to take a difficult integral, `∫u dv`, and turn it into an expression containing a much simpler integral, `∫v du`.

#### The Algorithm: A Strategic Choice in Action
Success with this method depends entirely on how we split our original integral into the parts `u` and `dv`. Let's explore this with our motivating problem: `∫x cos(x) dx`.

**Attempt 1: A Poor Choice**
Let's see what happens if we choose poorly.
1.  **Split:** Let `u = cos(x)` and `dv = x dx`.
2.  **Differentiate `u` and Integrate `dv`:**
    *   `u = cos(x)`  -->  `du = -sin(x) dx`
    *   `dv = x dx`    -->  `v = ∫x dx = (1/2)x²`
3.  **Assemble into the formula `uv - ∫v du`:**
    `∫x cos(x) dx = (cos(x))((1/2)x²) - ∫(1/2)x² (-sin(x)) dx`
    `= (1/2)x² cos(x) + (1/2)∫x² sin(x) dx`

**Analysis of Attempt 1:** We failed. Our new integral, `∫x² sin(x) dx`, is *more complicated* than our original integral. Our choice of `u` and `dv` made the problem worse.

**Attempt 2: A Strategic Choice**
Let's swap our choices.
1.  **Split:** Let `u = x` and `dv = cos(x) dx`.
2.  **Differentiate `u` and Integrate `dv`:**
    *   `u = x`          -->  `du = 1 dx = dx`
    *   `dv = cos(x) dx` -->  `v = ∫cos(x) dx = sin(x)` (No `+C` needed here)
3.  **Assemble into the formula `uv - ∫v du`:**
    `∫x cos(x) dx = (x)(sin(x)) - ∫sin(x) dx`

**Analysis of Attempt 2:** Success! The new integral, `∫sin(x) dx`, is one of our basic patterns. We have made the problem simpler.

4.  **Solve the New Integral:**
    *   We know `∫sin(x) dx = -cos(x)`.
    *   `∫x cos(x) dx = x sin(x) - (-cos(x)) + C`

5.  **Final Answer:**
    `∫x cos(x) dx = x sin(x) + cos(x) + C`

#### Generalizing the Strategy: How to Choose `u`
From our successful attempt, we can derive a general principle:
*   We chose `u = x` because its derivative, `du = dx`, is simpler.
*   We chose `dv = cos(x) dx` because it was easy to integrate.

This leads to a reliable mnemonic for choosing `u`: **LIATE**. Choose `u` to be the first function type from this priority list that appears in your integral. The rest of the integrand automatically becomes `dv`.

*   **L**ogarithmic (`ln(x)`)
*   **I**nverse trigonometric (`arcsin(x)`)
*   **A**lgebraic (polynomials like `x²`)
*   **T**rigonometric (`sin(x)`)
*   **E**xponential (`eˣ`)

In `∫x cos(x) dx`, we had **A**lgebraic (`x`) and **T**rigonometric (`cos(x)`). 'A' comes before 'T' in LIATE, so we correctly chose `u = x`.

#### Example 2: The `ln(x)` Trick
**Problem:** `∫ln(x) dx`
This doesn't look like a product, but we can treat it as `∫ln(x) * 1 dx`.

1.  **Split (LIATE):** We have **L**ogarithmic (`ln(x)`) and **A**lgebraic (`1`). 'L' is the highest priority.
    *   `u = ln(x)`
    *   `dv = 1 dx`
2.  **Differentiate `u` and Integrate `dv`:**
    *   `du = (1/x) dx`
    *   `v = x`
3.  **Assemble:**
    `∫ln(x) dx = (ln(x))(x) - ∫x * (1/x) dx`
4.  **Solve the New Integral:**
    `= x ln(x) - ∫1 dx`
    `= x ln(x) - x + C`

Integration by Parts is a systematic method for a whole class of integrals that are otherwise unsolvable. The key is the strategic choice of `u` to ensure the new integral is simpler than the original.

## **Section 6: Partial Fraction Decomposition (Integrating Rational Functions)**

#### The Big Picture
We have techniques for composite functions (u-substitution) and products (integration by parts). Now we address **rational functions**—one polynomial divided by another. Some are easy, like `∫(1/x)dx = ln|x| + C`. But what about a more complex case like `∫(1 / (x² - 4)) dx`? None of our current methods work.

**Partial Fraction Decomposition** is not a calculus technique, but rather a purely algebraic method. It allows us to take a complicated fraction and break it into a sum of simpler fractions that we already know how to integrate.

#### The Motivating Problem
Let's tackle `∫(1 / (x² - 4)) dx`.
The key insight is to recognize that `x² - 4` can be factored into `(x - 2)(x + 2)`. This suggests that the complex fraction `1 / ((x-2)(x+2))` might have come from adding two simpler fractions together, like this:

`A/(x - 2) + B/(x + 2) = 1 / ((x - 2)(x + 2))`

where `A` and `B` are some unknown constants. If we can find `A` and `B`, we can transform our difficult integral into a sum of two very easy integrals.

#### The Algorithm: An Algebraic Puzzle

The process is to find the values of `A` and `B`.

1.  **Factor the Denominator.**
    `x² - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)`

2.  **Set Up the Decomposition.**
    Write the fraction with unknown constants (`A`, `B`, etc.) for each factor in the denominator.
    `1 / ((x - 2)(x + 2)) = A/(x - 2) + B/(x + 2)`

3.  **Clear the Denominators.**
    Multiply both sides of the equation by the original denominator, `(x - 2)(x + 2)`.
    `1 = A(x + 2) + B(x - 2)`

4.  **Solve for the Constants (`A` and `B`).**
    This is the crucial step. There are two common methods.

    **Method 1: The Heaviside "Cover-Up" Method (Fast & Simple)**
    The equation `1 = A(x + 2) + B(x - 2)` must be true for *all* values of `x`. We can choose clever values of `x` to make terms disappear.
    *   To find `A`, choose `x` to make the `B` term zero. Let `x = 2`:
        `1 = A(2 + 2) + B(2 - 2)`
        `1 = A(4) + B(0)`
        `1 = 4A  =>  A = 1/4`
    *   To find `B`, choose `x` to make the `A` term zero. Let `x = -2`:
        `1 = A(-2 + 2) + B(-2 - 2)`
        `1 = A(0) + B(-4)`
        `1 = -4B  =>  B = -1/4`

    **Method 2: Equating Coefficients (More General)**
    Expand the right side and group by powers of `x`.
    `1 = Ax + 2A + Bx - 2B`
    `1 = (A + B)x + (2A - 2B)`
    The left side can be written as `0x + 1`. For the equation to be true, the coefficients of each power of `x` must match.
    *   `x¹ terms`: `A + B = 0`
    *   `x⁰ terms (constants)`: `2A - 2B = 1`
    This gives a system of two linear equations. Solving it gives `A = 1/4` and `B = -1/4`.

5.  **Rewrite and Solve the Integral.**
    Now that we know `A` and `B`, we can replace our original integral.
    `∫(1 / (x² - 4)) dx = ∫( (1/4)/(x - 2) + (-1/4)/(x + 2) ) dx`
    Split this into two integrals and pull out the constants:
    `= (1/4)∫(1/(x - 2))dx - (1/4)∫(1/(x + 2))dx`
    Both of these are of the form `∫(1/u)du = ln|u|`.
    `= (1/4)ln|x - 2| - (1/4)ln|x + 2| + C`

#### Important Notes
*   **Degree Check:** This method only works if the degree of the numerator is *less than* the degree of the denominator. If not, you must perform polynomial long division first. For example, to integrate `(x³ + 2x) / (x² - 4)`, you would first divide to get a polynomial plus a proper rational function.
*   **Repeated Factors:** For factors like `(x-2)²`, the decomposition must include terms for each power: `A/(x-2) + B/(x-2)²`.
*   **Irreducible Quadratics:** For factors that cannot be factored further, like `(x² + 1)`, the numerator in the decomposition must be a linear term: `(Ax + B)/(x² + 1)`.

Partial Fractions is a powerful tool for turning a single, difficult rational integral into a sum of simple logarithmic integrals.

## **Section 7: Dealing with Infinity and Impossibility**

#### The Big Picture
We have built a powerful toolkit for finding exact antiderivatives. But what happens in two common, challenging scenarios?
1.  What if the area we want to measure is infinitely long? Can an infinite region have a finite area?
2.  What if a function has no elementary antiderivative? Are we simply stuck?

This section addresses these two practical limitations of integration.

### **Part 1: Improper Integrals - Taming Infinity**

An integral is considered **improper** if one or both of its limits of integration are infinite, or if the function itself goes to infinity within the interval.

#### The Motivating Problem
Consider the region under the curve `f(x) = 1/x²`, from `x=1` all the way to `x=∞`. This region stretches infinitely far to the right. Can we calculate its area?

We cannot simply plug `∞` into our antiderivative. Infinity is not a number. Instead, we use a limit.

#### The Algorithm: The Limit Approach

1.  **Replace Infinity with a Variable:** Replace the `∞` symbol with a placeholder variable, like `b`.
    `∫₁^∞ (1/x²) dx` becomes `lim (b→∞) ∫₁ᵇ (1/x²) dx`

2.  **Solve the Definite Integral:** Evaluate the integral as you normally would, leaving your answer in terms of `b`.
    *   Rewrite as `∫₁ᵇ x⁻² dx`.
    *   The antiderivative is `x⁻¹ / -1 = -1/x`.
    *   Evaluate from 1 to `b`: `[-1/x]₁ᵇ = (-1/b) - (-1/1) = 1 - 1/b`.

3.  **Evaluate the Limit:** Now, take the limit of your result as `b` approaches infinity.
    *   `lim (b→∞) (1 - 1/b)`
    *   As `b` becomes infinitely large, the term `1/b` approaches 0.
    *   The limit is `1 - 0 = 1`.

**Result and Interpretation:**
The total area of this infinitely long region is exactly **1**. We say the integral **converges**.

Not all improper integrals converge.
*   **Example of Divergence:** `∫₁^∞ (1/x) dx`
    1.  `lim (b→∞) ∫₁ᵇ (1/x) dx`
    2.  `= lim (b→∞) [ln|x|]₁ᵇ`
    3.  `= lim (b→∞) (ln(b) - ln(1))`
    4.  `= lim (b→∞) (ln(b))`
    As `b` goes to infinity, `ln(b)` also goes to infinity. The area is infinite. We say this integral **diverges**.

A key rule of thumb for `p`-integrals: `∫₁^∞ (1/xᵖ) dx` converges if `p > 1` and diverges if `p ≤ 1`.

### **Part 2: When Formulas Fail - Numerical Integration**

#### The Motivating Problem
Consider the integral `∫₀¹ e⁻ˣ² dx`. This function, a form of the Gaussian or "bell curve," is fundamental to statistics and probability. However, it has a major problem: **it has no elementary antiderivative**. No combination of `ln(x)`, `eˣ`, `sin(x)`, polynomials, or other standard functions can be differentiated to give `e⁻ˣ²`. Our entire FTC-based toolkit is useless here.

#### The Solution: Back to the Beginning
When we cannot find an exact formula, we return to the core idea from Section 1: approximating the area with simple shapes. This is called **numerical integration** or **quadrature**. Computers use these methods to find highly accurate approximate answers.

A natural improvement over using rectangles (Riemann Sums) is to use trapezoids, which fit the curve's shape much better.

**The Trapezoid Rule**
Instead of a rectangle's flat top, a trapezoid connects the function's values at the start and end of an interval with a straight line. The area of a single trapezoid is `(1/2)(base₁ + base₂) × height`. In our case, the "bases" are the function values, and the "height" is the interval width `Δx`.

The formula for approximating an integral with `n` trapezoids is:
`Area ≈ (Δx/2) [f(x₀) + 2f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + ... + 2f(xₙ₋₁) + f(xₙ)]`

Let's apply this to our problem: `∫₀¹ e⁻ˣ² dx` with `n=4` trapezoids.
*   **Interval Width:** `Δx = (1-0)/4 = 0.25`.
*   **x-coordinates:** `0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1`.
*   **Function Values:**
    *   `f(0) = e⁰ = 1`
    *   `f(0.25) = e⁻⁰.⁰⁶²⁵ ≈ 0.939`
    *   `f(0.5) = e⁻⁰.²⁵ ≈ 0.779`
    *   `f(0.75) = e⁻⁰.⁵⁶²⁵ ≈ 0.570`
    *   `f(1) = e⁻¹ ≈ 0.368`

*   **Calculation:**
    `Area ≈ (0.25/2) [1 + 2(0.939) + 2(0.779) + 2(0.570) + 0.368]`
    `Area ≈ 0.125 * [1 + 1.878 + 1.558 + 1.140 + 0.368]`
    `Area ≈ 0.125 * [5.944] ≈ 0.7430`

The true value is approximately `0.7468...`. Our trapezoid approximation with only 4 slices is already quite close. A computer using thousands of slices can achieve accuracy to many decimal places.

**The Takeaway:**
When an exact antiderivative is impossible to find, we rely on numerical methods. These algorithms are the backbone of how scientific computing, engineering, and statistics handle real-world integration problems.

### **Section 8: Conclusion**

We have systematically deconstructed integral calculus, from the intuitive concept of a Riemann Sum to the power of the Fundamental Theorem and its core techniques: u-substitution, integration by parts, and partial fractions.

The integral sign `∫` is no longer abstract. It is the tool for finding a total by summing infinite slices.
