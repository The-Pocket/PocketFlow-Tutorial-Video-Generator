<!-- START CHAPTER 1 -->
<!-- Because this content is the core hook of the entire presentation and matches the thumbnail, this is a POWER TEXT slide designed for maximum impact. This is the first of a two-slide sequence using data-auto-animate to create a dramatic reveal. Text analysis: 'The WRONG choice...' (18 characters) is concise and perfect for r-fit-text. I'm using the red color (#ff6b6b) to emphasize the word 'WRONG', setting up the central paradox immediately. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">The <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">WRONG</mark> choice...</h1>
</section>

<!-- This is the second POWER TEXT slide in the opening sequence, completing the paradoxical hook. CRITICAL: It uses data-auto-animate to smoothly transition from the previous slide. The new line '...is the RIGHT one.' appears, with 'RIGHT' highlighted in contrasting green (#4CAF50). The pre-existing text from the previous slide is NOT fragmented; it animates into place automatically. This two-step reveal is far more impactful than showing the full sentence at once. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">The <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">WRONG</mark> choice...</h1>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">...is the <mark style="color: #4CAF50;">RIGHT</mark> one.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this content begins the main argument by stating a common belief, this is a POWER TEXT slide. This is the first part of a two-part sentence, split for pacing. Text analysis: "You've been taught your entire life to find the winning strategy..." (68 characters) is an ideal length for a single, impactful r-fit-text element. This sets up the conventional wisdom that the rest of the presentation will deconstruct. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">You've been taught your entire life to find the winning strategy...</h2>
</section>

<!-- Continuing from the previous slide, this POWER TEXT slide completes the thought using data-auto-animate for a smooth transition. Text analysis: "...and stick to it." (16 characters) is short and punchy. Placing it on a new slide gives the line its own weight and creates a deliberate pause, emphasizing the point before moving on. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">You've been taught your entire life to find the winning strategy...</h2>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">...and <mark>stick to it</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide provides relatable examples of the "stick to it" mentality, it's a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: The total character count (98) is good for r-fit-text. I will use fragments to reveal each example ("best route," "best restaurant," "best framework") sequentially. This builds a rhythm and reinforces the repetitive nature of the flawed logic. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">Find the best route to work.</h2>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">The best restaurant in town.</h2>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">The best framework for your project.</h2>
</section>

<!-- This is a POWER TEXT slide that introduces the key term 'exploit'. Text analysis: "And once you find it? You exploit it." (34 characters) is a strong, concise statement. I've highlighted the word 'exploit' as it's a core concept in reinforcement learning and directly contrasts with 'explore', which will be introduced later. This slide acts as a conceptual anchor. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">And once you find it?</h1>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text fragment">You <mark>exploit</mark> it.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide uses data-auto-animate to build on the previous point with another quick, impactful statement. Text analysis: "You use it over and over..." (25 characters) is short and effective. This reinforces the idea of exploitation and sets up the rhetorical question that follows. The rapid succession of slides creates a feeling of being stuck in a loop. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">You use it over and over...</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide uses data-auto-animate to complete the thought from the previous slide, posing a critical question to the audience. Text analysis: "...why would you ever choose the second-best option on purpose?" (64 characters) is a perfect length for r-fit-text. Highlighting "second-best" frames the central challenge and forces the audience to confront their own assumptions. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">You use it over and over...</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">...why would you ever choose the <mark>second-best</mark> option on purpose?</h2>
</section>

<!-- This is a POWER TEXT slide used for pacing and building suspense. It presents the audience's likely internal monologue. Text analysis: The two phrases "It seems logical" and "It seems smart" are very short. I'll present them on a single slide with a fragment to create a one-two punch that validates the audience's thinking before immediately contradicting it. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">It seems logical.</h1>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text fragment fade-in">It seems smart.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this is the first major reveal contradicting the audience's belief, it's a POWER TEXT slide. This is the first of a two-slide sequence with data-auto-animate. Text analysis: "And it is completely, fundamentally..." (36 characters) is the setup, building tension for the punchline on the next slide. The ellipsis is key to the pacing. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">And it is completely, fundamentally...</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide delivers the punchline to the previous setup, creating a dramatic refutation. CRITICAL: It uses data-auto-animate for a seamless transition. Text analysis: "wrong." is only 5 characters. Per the guidelines, I will use a large fixed font size (12em) instead of r-fit-text for maximum impact without becoming unreadably large. The red color reinforces the negative connotation. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">And it is completely, fundamentally...</h1>
    <h1 style="font-size: 12em; color: #ff6b6b;">wrong.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This is a POWER TEXT slide that explains *why* the common thinking is wrong. Text analysis: "Most people think the goal of intelligence is to always pick the winner." (71 characters) fits well within the r-fit-text sweet spot. This slide clearly states the misconception that will be addressed. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Most people think the goal of intelligence is to always pick the winner.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide serves as a direct, blunt contradiction to the previous statement. Text analysis: "They're wrong." (12 characters) is extremely concise. Using r-fit-text and the emphatic red color makes this short statement land with significant force. This rapid-fire contradiction maintains the presentation's provocative tone. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text" style="color: #ff6b6b;">They're wrong.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this POWER TEXT slide explains the consequence of the flawed thinking, it sets up the problem. Text analysis: "And frankly, they're leaving value on the table." (49 characters) is a great length for r-fit-text. It introduces the idea of opportunity cost, a key theme in reinforcement learning. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">And frankly, they're leaving value on the table.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide, the first of a two-part data-auto-animate sequence, describes the trap of local optima. Text analysis: "They get stuck in a loop of 'good enough'..." (42 characters) is a relatable phrase. I've marked 'good enough' to emphasize the concept of settling for a suboptimal solution. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">They get stuck in a loop of <mark>"good enough"</mark>...</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide completes the previous thought with data-auto-animate, revealing the ultimate goal. The transition from "good enough" to "great" is the core message. Text analysis: "...without ever discovering 'great.'" (33 characters) provides a powerful contrast. Highlighting 'great' in green (#4CAF50) visually resolves the tension and points towards the better alternative. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">They get stuck in a loop of <mark>"good enough"</mark>...</h1>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">...without ever discovering <mark style="color: #4CAF50;">"great."</mark></h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide formally introduces the central topic. Text analysis: "This is the central problem of Reinforcement Learning." (54 characters) is a clear, declarative statement that acts as a signpost, telling the audience that we are now defining the core issue. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">This is the central problem of Reinforcement Learning.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide, part of a three-slide sequence, reframes the goal of intelligence. Text analysis: "It's not about being right 100% of the time." (44 characters) directly challenges the conventional definition of success and continues the theme of counter-intuitive thinking. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">It's not about being right 100% of the time.</h2>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide, using data-auto-animate, provides the resolution to the previous setup. Text analysis: "It's about knowing when to be wrong." (34 characters) is the key insight. Highlighting the word 'when' focuses the audience on the strategic element of making mistakes, which is the essence of exploration. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">It's not about being right 100% of the time.</h2>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">It's about knowing <mark>when</mark> to be wrong.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide makes a bold, counter-intuitive promise, it's a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: "In this video, I'm going to show you why being 'stupid' 10% of the time is the single smartest thing you can do." (100 characters) is at the upper limit for r-fit-text but works perfectly as a strong thesis statement for the entire video. Highlighting 'stupid' drives home the paradox. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">I'm going to show you why being <mark>'stupid'</mark> 10% of the time is the single smartest thing you can do.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This is a POWER TEXT slide designed to introduce the key problem and its solution. I'm using fragments to build the concepts step-by-step: first the problem name, then the algorithm name. This controlled reveal prevents cognitive overload and gives each term its own moment of focus. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">We're going to break down the classic...</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text"><mark style="color: #4CAF50;">Multi-Armed Bandit</mark> problem</h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text" style="margin-top: 40px;">...and the simple algorithm that solves it:</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text"><mark style="color: #4CAF50;">Epsilon-Greedy</mark></h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide uses data-auto-animate to transition from the problem definition to its significance. Text analysis: "This isn't just a brain teaser." (30 characters) is a short, transitional phrase that dismisses the idea that this is a trivial problem. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">This isn't just a brain teaser.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide completes the thought from the previous slide with data-auto-animate, emphasizing the foundational importance of the concept. Text analysis: "This is the bedrock." (19 characters) is a powerful, metaphorical statement. Highlighting 'bedrock' reinforces its status as a fundamental principle. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">This isn't just a brain teaser.</h1>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">This is the <mark>bedrock</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This is a POWER TEXT slide, the first in a sequence using data-auto-animate to explain the core idea. Text analysis: "Understand this one idea..." (26 characters) serves as a simple setup, directing the audience's attention to the crucial concept that follows. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">Understand this one idea...</h2>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide uses data-auto-animate to reveal the core concept. Text analysis: "...the balance between exploring and exploiting..." (46 characters) introduces the two key terms of the explore-exploit dilemma. Marking both 'exploring' and 'exploiting' visually separates and emphasizes these foundational concepts. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">Understand this one idea...</h2>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">...the balance between <mark>exploring</mark> and <mark>exploiting</mark>...</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide uses data-auto-animate to state the payoff for understanding the concept. Text analysis: "...and you unlock the core logic behind every single RL agent." (62 characters) is a powerful promise that connects this simple problem to the entire field of Reinforcement Learning. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">Understand this one idea...</h2>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">...the balance between <mark>exploring</mark> and <mark>exploiting</mark>...</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">...and you unlock the core logic behind <mark>every single</mark> RL agent.</h2>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide provides examples of the concept's broad applicability. I'm using two fragments to build from a well-known, complex example (AlphaGo) to a common, relatable one (Amazon recommendations), demonstrating the scale of this idea. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">From the one that beat the world champion at Go...</h2>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">...to the one that's probably trying to sell you something on Amazon right now.</h2>
</section>

<!-- This is a POWER TEXT slide that serves as a transition to the next part of the presentation. A three-step reveal using fragments builds anticipation and clearly signals a shift in focus from theory to a practical setting. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">So, to understand how AIs *really* learn...</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">...we're not going to start with code.</h1>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text" style="color: #4CAF50;">We're going to start in a <mark>casino</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This final POWER TEXT slide officially announces the transition to the next chapter. A simple two-line structure with the chapter title clearly signposts the end of the hook and the beginning of the main problem setup. -->
<section>
    <h2 style="font-size: 3em;">Which brings us to our next section:</h2>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text" style="color: #4CAF50;">The Casino Dilemma: Your High-Stakes Test</h1>
</section>
<!-- END CHAPTER 1 -->

<!-- START CHAPTER 2 -->
<!-- Because this content serves as a transition from the abstract introduction to a concrete example, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: "Alright, forget the theory for a second" (38 characters) and "Let's make this real" (19 characters) are both short and impactful. I will split them into two slides with a data-auto-animate transition for pacing, letting the first statement land before delivering the call to action. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Alright, forget the theory for a second.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide continues from the previous one, completing the transition with data-auto-animate for a smooth reveal. Text analysis: "Let’s make this real" (19 characters) is a punchy, engaging follow-up. Using a different text element (h2 vs h1) adds a nice visual rhythm to the animation. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Alright, forget the theory for a second.</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text" style="color: #4CAF50;">Let’s make this <mark>real</mark>.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this content introduces the core problem scenario, this is an EDUCATIONAL slide. It's crucial to establish the problem context clearly, so I'm creating a setup box that will persist across later slides. Density is low, with fragments revealing each piece of the scenario (the setting, the resources, the goal) step-by-step to prevent overwhelming the audience. This structured presentation is key for a technical problem. -->

    <div style="background-color: #333; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
        <h3 style="color: #4CAF50; margin: 0; font-size: 1.8em;">The Casino Dilemma</h3>
        <div style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px;">
            <p><strong>The Setting:</strong> A row of ten slot machines.</p>

            <p class="fragment fade-in"><strong>Your Goal:</strong> Walk out with the <mark>most money possible</mark>.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Because this content introduces the central conflict or 'catch', this is a POWER TEXT slide using data-auto-animate to build on the previous setup. The text is broken into two impactful statements for pacing. Text analysis: "Here's the catch" (16 characters) is the setup, followed by the reveal of the problem. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Here's the catch.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide continues the thought from the previous one. Text analysis: The core problem "Each machine is programmed differently" (36 characters) is stated clearly. I'll use fragments to progressively reveal the consequences: one might be a jackpot, another a dud. This builds the sense of uncertainty. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">Each machine is programmed differently.</h2>
    <h3 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">One might be a secret <mark style="color: #4CAF50;">jackpot</mark> machine.</h3>
    <h3 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">Another might be a total <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">dud</mark>.</h3>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide uses data-auto-animate to deliver the core problem with maximum impact. Text analysis: "The problem?" (11 characters) is a perfect hook. This will be a two-slide sequence. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">The problem?</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide completes the reveal from the previous one using data-auto-animate. Text analysis: "You don't know which is which" (27 characters) is the crucial piece of information. Highlighting "don't know" in red emphasizes the uncertainty that drives the entire problem. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">The problem?</h1>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">You <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">don't know</mark> which is which.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide directly engages the audience with a question. Text analysis: The phrases are short and direct. I will use fragments to ask the questions sequentially, creating a conversational and thought-provoking moment. This prompts the audience to consider their own strategy before one is presented. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">So... how do you play?</h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text" style="margin-top: 40px;">What is your strategy for spending those 1000 tokens?</h2>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide connects the simple casino game to the broader topic of RL. Text analysis: The initial statement "This isn't just a brain teaser" (30 characters) sets up a reveal. The follow-up statement "This little casino game is the perfect, simplified model..." (100 characters) is a good length to explain the significance. Highlighting "perfect" emphasizes its value as a teaching tool. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">This isn't just a brain teaser.</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">This is the <mark>perfect</mark>, simplified model for the most important trade-off in all of Reinforcement Learning.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide introduces the formal name of the problem. A two-step fragment reveal introduces the common name ("slot machines") before correcting it with the technical term ("k-Armed Bandit"), which is a classic teaching technique. Highlighting the formal name in green gives it authority. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">In our world, we don't call this a row of slot machines.</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">We call it the <mark style="color: #4CAF50;">k-Armed Bandit</mark> problem.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this is a transition slide signaling a shift to more formal definitions, it's a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: The tone is conversational and reassuring ("nerdy labels," "don't worry"). Using fragments helps pace the transition from the problem analogy to the technical terms. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">Let's put some official, nerdy labels on this.</h2>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">Don't worry, this is just giving names to things you already understand.</h2>
</section>

<!-- This is a TECHNICAL slide designed to introduce the core vocabulary. Density: Medium. I'm using a list format with fragments to introduce each term—action, reward, and action-value—one by one. This prevents cognitive overload and allows the presenter to explain each concept before moving to the next. The final term, `q*(a)`, is highlighted as the most important one. -->
<section data-background-color="#1a1a1a">
    <h2 style="color: #4CAF50;">The Vocabulary</h2>
    <ul style="font-size: 1.8em; line-height: 1.6;">
        <li>An <strong style="color: #4CAF50;">action</strong>, `a`, is your choice of which machine to play.</li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in">The <strong style="color: #4CAF50;">reward</strong>, `R_t`, is the coins the machine spits out.</li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in">Each machine's true average payout is its <strong style="color: #ff6b6b;">action-value</strong>, written as <code style="background-color: #333; padding: 5px 10px; border-radius: 5px;">q*(a)</code>.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Because this content emphasizes the importance of a single concept, `q*(a)`, it's a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: "This q*(a) is the number you WISH you knew" (43 characters) is direct and relatable. Highlighting "WISH you knew" in red reinforces the idea of it being a hidden, desirable piece of information. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">This <code style="font-size: 1em;">q*(a)</code> is the number you <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">WISH</mark> you knew.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This is a TECHNICAL slide presenting the formal mathematical definition of q*(a). The LaTeX formula is the central element. I will keep this formula on screen for the next few slides while I demystify it, providing a stable visual anchor. This is a deliberate choice for slower pacing during a technical explanation. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 style="color: #4CAF50;">The Formal Definition</h2>
    <div data-id="formula" style="text-align: center; margin: 25px 0;">
        \[ q_*(a) = \mathbb{E}[R_t | A_t = a] \]
    </div>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide is the first in a rapid sequence designed to disarm the audience's potential fear of the math. Text analysis: "Now, your eyes might glaze over" (30 characters) acknowledges the audience's feeling directly, building rapport. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <div data-id="formula" style="text-align: center; margin: 25px 0; font-size: 1.5em;">

    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Now, your eyes might glaze over.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide continues the sequence, using data-auto-animate. Text analysis: "Don't let them" (14 characters) is a short, direct command. It's paired with the next slide to create a quick one-two punch that reassures the viewer. The formula is kept in the background but faded, maintaining context. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <div data-id="formula" style="text-align: center; margin: 25px 0; font-size: 1.5em;">
        \[ q_*(a) = \mathbb{E}[R_t | A_t = a] \]
    </div>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Don't let them.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide is the third in the rapid sequence. Text analysis: "It's not" (7 characters) is extremely short, so I use a larger font size. This simple, confident statement, following the build-up, is designed to be very impactful. The faded formula remains for context. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <div data-id="formula" style="text-align: center; margin: 25px 0; font-size: 1.5em;">
        \[ q_*(a) = \mathbb{E}[R_t | A_t = a] \]
    </div>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">It's <mark style="color: #ff6b6b">not</mark> complicated.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This EDUCATIONAL slide breaks down the formula into plain English. The formula is still visible at the top for reference. I use fragments to reveal each part of the plain-language explanation, matching it to the mathematical symbols. This connects the abstract math to concrete concepts the audience already understands. -->

    <div style="font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 40px;">
        <p>All this says is:</p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in">"The <strong style="color: #4CAF50;">true value of an action a</strong>..."</p>

        <p class="fragment fade-in">"...<strong style="color: #4CAF50;">given</strong> you chose that action."</p>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide provides the final, simplest translation of the formula. Text analysis: "In casino terms? It's the machine's true average payout." (63 characters) is a perfect, concise summary that solidifies understanding by tying the formal definition back to the original analogy. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">In casino terms?</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">It's the machine's <mark style="color: #4CAF50;">true average payout</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide re-centers the entire presentation on the core conflict. Text analysis: "The entire game... boils down to one fact:" (43 characters) sets up the reveal. This is the first slide of a two-part auto-animate sequence. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">The entire game... the entire challenge...</h2>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">boils down to <mark>one fact</mark>:</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide delivers the punchline with data-auto-animate. Text analysis: "You don't know q*(a)." (21 characters) is a stark, powerful statement. Highlighting "don't know" in red reinforces that this lack of knowledge is the central problem to be solved. -->
<section data-auto-animate>

(3 characters) is extremely short. As per the guidelines, using a large fixed font size instead of r-fit-text will create a more impactful, readable visual. This sets a serious tone for the problem we're about to solve. -->
<section data-transition="fade-in" data-background-color="#000000">
    <h1 style="font-size: 12em;">So.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this content states the core problem this chapter will solve, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: "Our greedy agent is trapped" (26 characters) is a short, impactful statement. Highlighting "trapped" in red emphasizes the negative state and directly references the failure from the previous chapter. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Our greedy agent is <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">trapped</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this content elaborates on the agent's failure, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: The original sentence is long (167 characters), so I've broken it into two impactful parts across two slides. The first part, "It’s stuck pulling the wrong lever for the rest of its life..." (61 characters), is a good length for r-fit-text and establishes the perpetual nature of the error. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">It’s stuck pulling the wrong lever for the rest of its life...</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide completes the thought from the previous one, it's a POWER TEXT slide using data-auto-animate for a smooth transition. Text analysis: The second part of the sentence, "...convinced it's the jackpot, while the real treasure is completely ignored" (83 characters), provides the reason for the failure. The visual build-up adds to the drama of the agent's mistake. -->
<section data-auto-animate>

    <h2 class="r-fit-text">...convinced it's the jackpot, while the real treasure is completely ignored.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide delivers the final verdict on the previous strategy, this is a POWER TEXT slide using a two-part reveal for impact. Text analysis: "The logical, common-sense strategy..." (37 characters) sets up the punchline, reminding the audience that the failed approach seemed reasonable at first. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">The logical, common-sense strategy...</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide delivers the punchline, this is a POWER TEXT slide using data-auto-animate. Text analysis: Adding the word "failed" and highlighting it in red provides a stark, clear conclusion. The animation makes the word "failed" pop, emphasizing the severity of the problem we need to solve. -->

    <h1 class="r-fit-text">The logical, common-sense strategy... <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">failed</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this content transitions from the problem to the search for a solution, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It uses fragments to ask two key questions, engaging the audience and framing the rest of the chapter. Text analysis: The questions are short and direct, perfect for sequential reveal. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">So how do we fix it?</h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">How do we break it out of this trap?</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this content addresses and dismisses a potential audience assumption, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: "You might think the solution is some complicated, PhD-level math" (68 characters) is a good length for r-fit-text. It sets up a contrast with the actual simple solution. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">You might think the solution is some complicated, PhD-level math.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide provides the simple, direct refutation of the previous slide's idea, it's a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: "It's not." (8 characters) is short and powerful. I'm using r-fit-text as it's over 5 characters and this creates a strong, declarative statement. The green color signals that this simplicity is a good thing. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text" style="color: #4CAF50;">It's not.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this content describes the nature of the solution, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: The original text is a series of short, punchy descriptions. I'll split them across slides for maximum impact. "The fix is so simple, it’s almost insulting." (43 characters) is the first part. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">The fix is so simple, it’s almost <mark>insulting</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide continues the description, this is a POWER TEXT slide using data-auto-animate. Text analysis: "It's a hack. It’s a kludge." (24 characters) adds to the characterization of the solution as unconventional but effective. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">The fix is so simple, it’s almost <mark>insulting</mark>.</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">It's a hack. It’s a kludge.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide completes the description with a powerful statement, it's a POWER TEXT slide using data-auto-animate. Text analysis: "And it is one of the most powerful ideas in all of reinforcement learning." (81 characters) is a fantastic, impactful statement that elevates the "hack" to a fundamental concept. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text" style="opacity: 0.2;">The fix is so simple, it’s almost insulting.</h1>

<!-- Because this content builds anticipation for the solution reveal, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: The two short phrases are delivered with a fragment to create a conversational pause before the big reveal. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Here’s the solution.</h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">Are you ready for this?</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this is the single most important idea of the chapter, it's a POWER TEXT slide revealed over two stages for dramatic effect. Text analysis: The first part, "Be greedy most of the time..." (28 characters), establishes the baseline behavior, which is familiar to the audience. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Be greedy most of the time...</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide reveals the "hack," this is a POWER TEXT slide using data-auto-animate. Text analysis: The second part, "...but every once in a while... do something completely, utterly, random," reveals the core concept. Highlighting "random" in red emphasizes the counter-intuitive nature of the fix. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Be greedy most of the time...</h1>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">...but every once in a while... do something completely, utterly, <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">random</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide confirms the simplicity of the solution, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: "That's it. That's the secret." (27 characters) is a direct, reinforcing statement that lets the previous idea sink in. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">That's it. That's the secret.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide rephrases the core idea in a more provocative way, it is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: The sentence "for a small fraction of the time, throw your logic out the window and just... be an idiot" is broken into two parts with a data-auto-animate transition to build impact. This first part sets the stage. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">For a small fraction of the time...</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide completes the provocative thought, it is a POWER TEXT slide using data-auto-animate. Text analysis: The phrase "...throw your logic out the window and just... be an idiot" lands with more force after the pause. Highlighting "idiot" makes the counter-intuitive advice memorable and sticky. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">For a small fraction of the time...</h2>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">...throw your logic out the window and just... be an <mark>idiot</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this content explains the "why" behind the "idiot" strategy, this is a POWER TEXT slide with a multi-part reveal. Text analysis: Each phrase is revealed with a fragment, creating a poetic, step-by-step explanation of what this "intentional chaos" really represents. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">This small dose of intentional <mark style="color: #4CAF50;">chaos</mark> is the key.</h2>

    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">"<mark>But what if I'm wrong?</mark>"</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this content introduces a relatable analogy, it is an EDUCATIONAL slide using a side-by-side comparison. This format is perfect for contrasting the two behaviors (exploit vs. explore) in a clear, visual way. The green/red color scheme reinforces the concepts. -->

<!-- Because this slide explains the trade-off of the analogy, it's a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: I'm breaking the cost/benefit analysis into two slides. This first one, "The cost of exploration? A terrible 2/10 restaurant" (54 characters), highlights the downside in red, making the risk clear. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">The cost of exploration?</h2>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text" style="color: #ff6b6b;">A terrible 2/10 restaurant. A wasted meal.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide shows the potential upside, it's a POWER TEXT slide using data-auto-animate. The contrast with the previous slide is key. Text analysis: The phrases "...you might land on a new 10/10 spot" and "A new favorite" highlight the massive potential reward in green. -->
