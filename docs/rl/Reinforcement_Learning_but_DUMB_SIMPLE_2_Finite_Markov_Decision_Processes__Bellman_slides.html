<!-- START CHAPTER 1 -->

<!-- Because this content is the opening hook that directly states the technical concept viewers will master, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: "What's 'Finite Markov Decision Processes'?" (41 characters) - perfect length for r-fit-text with maximum impact. Highlight the technical term in green to signal this is positive/learnable content. Context: This is the thumbnail text and opening slide, so it must immediately establish the technical focus while being approachable. The question format creates engagement while promising concrete learning. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">What's "<span style="color: #4CAF50;">Finite Markov Decision Processes</span>"?</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this content acknowledges where the technical audience has encountered the term to build credibility, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: "You may hear this term thrown around in..." (42 characters) - good for r-fit-text. Single line enumeration "AI papers, RL textbooks, research discussions" (49 characters) - perfect for impact. Fragment the enumeration for emphasis. Context: Following the opening question slide, this builds rapport with technical viewers by acknowledging their prior exposure. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">You may hear this term thrown around in...</h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text"><span style="color: #ff6b6b;">AI papers</span>, <span style="color: #ff6b6b;">RL textbooks</span>, <span style="color: #ff6b6b;">research discussions</span></h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this content validates the audience's likely initial reaction to the technical term, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: "It sounds intimidating" (22 characters) - excellent for r-fit-text with emotional impact. Follow with "PhD students" fragment (40 characters including context) for emphasis. Context: After acknowledging where they've heard the term, this validates their intimidation while setting up for demystification. The progression builds: recognition → intimidation → revelation (next slide). -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">It sounds <span style="color: #ff6b6b;">intimidating</span>.</h1>
    <h2 class="fade-in r-fit-text">It sounds like something only <span style="color: #ff6b6b;">PhD students</span> should touch.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this content is a pivotal revelation that reframes the intimidating concept as foundational, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: "But here's the thing:" (20 characters) - perfect setup for r-fit-text. "It's the mathematical foundation" needs to be split for impact. Context: This is the key turning point from intimidation to empowerment, setting up the credibility examples. Must build anticipation for the revelation. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">But here's the thing:</h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">It's the <span style="color: #4CAF50;">mathematical foundation</span> underneath every major AI breakthrough.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this content provides concrete evidence of the concept's importance through recognizable examples, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: Single line enumeration "AlphaGo, ChatGPT's RL, autonomous vehicles" (44 characters) - excellent for r-fit-text impact. Context: Following the foundation claim, this provides immediate credibility through systems the technical audience knows and respects. The examples validate the "foundation" claim. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text"><span style="color: #4CAF50;">AlphaGo</span>, <span style="color: #4CAF50;">ChatGPT's RL</span>, <span style="color: #4CAF50;">autonomous vehicles</span></h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">They all rely on this core framework.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this content makes the key promise about what the audience will achieve, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Text analysis: "And we're going to build rock-solid intuition for it" (54 characters) - good for r-fit-text. "Using nothing more than a 2x2 grid and basic math" (51 characters) - perfect complement. Context: After establishing credibility with major AI systems, this promises practical mastery through simple tools. The contrast between "major AI breakthroughs" and "2x2 grid" creates intrigue and accessibility. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">And we're going to build <span style="color: #4CAF50;">rock-solid intuition</span> for it</h1>

<!-- Because this content makes a promise to the viewer, it's a POWER TEXT slide. It's broken into a sequence of four slides to emphasize each part of the promise, creating a motivational and empowering tone. This first slide sets the stage by contrasting with "just theory." -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">You will not just learn the theory.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide continues the promise, using data-auto-animate. It introduces a key idea—"think like an agent"—and highlights it in green to frame it as a positive, achievable skill. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">You will not just learn the theory.</h1>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">You will learn to <mark style="color: #4CAF50;">think like an agent</mark>.</h1>

<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">But before our agent can learn, or win, or even move...</h2>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide completes the transition started in the previous slide. It introduces the concept of a "universe," which directly sets up the topic of the next chapter. -->

    <div style="font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 1.6;">
        <p>This is more specific. It asks:</p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in" style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 30px;"><strong>"How good is this <mark>move</mark>?"</strong></p>
        <div class="fragment fade-in" style="margin-top: 40px;">
            <p>We write it as: <code style="font-size: 1.5em;">q<sub>π</sub>(s, a)</code></p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #999;">Most people just call it the <strong>Q-value</strong> (pronounced like the letter).</p>

<!-- Because this slide provides a concrete example to differentiate `q` from `v`, this is an EDUCATIONAL slide. It uses the "Lost Tourist" policy to show that even in a generally bad state (A), some actions are much worse than others. This breakdown by action is the key intuition for Q-values. Fragments are used to reveal each action's value sequentially. -->

<!-- Because this is the core thematic question of the chapter, this is a POWER TEXT slide using a two-part reveal with data-auto-animate. The contrast between "knowing" and "doing" is the central idea that will be explored. -->

    <h1 class="r-fit-text">How do we go from *knowing*...</h1>

<section>

    <h1 class="r-fit-text fragment fade-in">...is almost insultingly simple.</h1>

<!-- Because this slide serves as a title card for the main concept, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It formally names the strategy and reinforces its simplicity with the follow-up text. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">The Greedy Revolution</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">That's it. That's the entire strategy.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide explains the logic behind the greedy approach, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It uses a fragment to introduce the key conceptual leap: temporarily ignoring the current policy to make a better, one-step decision. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">We have `v(s)`. It tells us the long-term score *if we follow our current dumb policy*.</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">But what if we just... ignored our policy for one second?</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide makes the abstract idea of "ignoring the policy" concrete, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It frames the greedy action as a simple question, making the process feel intuitive and logical. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">What if, standing on Square A, instead of picking a random direction...</h2>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text fragment fade-in">...we used our new value map to look just <mark>one step ahead</mark>?</h2>

<!-- END CHAPTER 11 -->

<!-- START CHAPTER 12 -->

<!-- Because this content serves as a celebratory opening for the chapter, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It recaps the major achievement from the previous chapter in a short, impactful statement using r-fit-text. This creates a positive and energetic start, signaling a major milestone. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">We did it.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide elaborates on the achievement, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It uses a two-part reveal with fragments to name the two master algorithms and give them their memorable nicknames from the previous chapter, reinforcing the sense of accomplishment before the chapter's big turn. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">We have the two master algorithms.</h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">Policy Iteration, the <mark>Patient Planner</mark>.</h2>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">Value Iteration, the <mark>Impatient Genius</mark>.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide summarizes the power of the algorithms, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Highlighting "guaranteed" in green emphasizes the mathematical certainty of the solutions they provide, which makes the upcoming reveal of their limitations even more impactful. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">Two different paths, same destination: the optimal policy.</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">Both are mathematically <mark style="color: #4CAF50;">guaranteed</mark> to solve the puzzle.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide uses strong, metaphorical language to describe the power the audience now has, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The sequence of "crystal ball," "hammer," and "ladder" creates a powerful, memorable image of the tools they've just learned to build. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">We have the crystal ball.</h1>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">We have the hammer.</h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">We have a ladder that lets an AI climb out of chaos and into perfection.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide serves as the major pivot or "turn" for the entire chapter, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The sequence uses a dramatic pause to build suspense, leading from a confident question to a shocking, definitive reversal. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">So... we’re done, right?</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">We have the keys to the kingdom. We can solve any problem now.</h2>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide delivers the punchline to the previous setup. The phrase "Not. Even. Close." is broken up for maximum dramatic effect and presented in a large font to signal a complete shift in the narrative. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text" style="color: #ff6b6b;">Not. Even. Close.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this content explains *why* it's not over, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It introduces the idea of an "idealized theory" and "asterisks," which are relatable concepts that set up the reveal of the specific limitations. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">You've just been shown the perfect, idealized theory.</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">The kind you find in chapter 3 of a textbook, right before all the asterisks and exceptions show up.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide introduces the core problem of the chapter, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Highlighting "fine print" in red frames it as a negative, cautionary concept, and the two-part reveal with a fragment builds anticipation for what the "catches" are. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Because these beautiful, perfect algorithms... they have some <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">fine print</mark>.</h1>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">They come with two... <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">catches</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this content elaborates on the consequence of the catches, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The contrast between the "tiny 2x2 grid" and "any problem that actually matters" is the core theme of the chapter, and highlighting "shatter" emphasizes the fragility of the methods. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">Two impossibly demanding requirements that hold true for our tiny 2x2 grid...</h2>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">...but <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">shatter</mark> the moment you try to use them on any problem that actually matters.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide serves as a dramatic transition and call to action, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The language is active and direct, signaling to the audience that they are about to learn the critical limitations. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">It's time to read the fine print.</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text fragment fade-in">It's time to understand why everything we've built so far... is still just a <mark>toy</mark>.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide introduces the first of the two major limitations, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The title is provocative ("Universe's Source Code") and immediately grabs attention, setting the stage for the technical explanation that follows. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text" style="color: #ff6b6b;">Catch #1:</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">You Need The Universe's Source Code</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide explains the first catch, this is an EDUCATIONAL slide. It formally names "Dynamic Programming" and states its core, non-negotiable requirement. Highlighting "perfect model of the environment" is crucial as this is the key vocabulary and concept. -->
<section>
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">The first catch is the biggest lie of all.</h2>
    <div style="font-size: 1.4em; text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 1.6;">
        <p>Both methods belong to <strong style="color: #4CAF50;">Dynamic Programming</strong>.</p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in">This family has one requirement.</p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in" style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 30px;">You must have a <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">perfect model of the environment</mark>.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide demystifies the term "perfect model," this is a TECHNICAL slide. It presents the formal notation `p(s', r | s, a)` and then immediately translates it into plain, intuitive language, making the complex concept accessible. The "god-like certainty" phrase is memorable and effective. -->
<section>
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em;">What does that mean?</h2>
    <div style="font-size: 1.4em; text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 1.6;">
        <p>Know all the rules of the universe <mark>in advance</mark>.</p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in">Know the exact probability of every outcome for every action from every state.</p>
        <div class="fragment fade-in" style="margin-top: 30px;">
            \[ p(s', r | s, a) \]
        </div>
        <p class="fragment fade-in" style="margin-top: 30px;">With god-like certainty: state A + East = state B (100%) + reward (-1).</p>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide uses a strong, relatable analogy to explain the absurdity of the requirement, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The video game analogy is highly effective at making the abstract problem of needing a perfect model feel concrete and unreasonable. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Think about how insane this is.</h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">It's like demanding a video game give you a perfect walkthrough...</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">...before you're even allowed to press <mark>start</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide connects the abstract limitation back to real-world examples, this is an EDUCATIONAL slide. It lists several clear, intuitive cases where a perfect model is impossible, grounding the theoretical problem in practical reality. -->
<section>
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em;">For our 2x2 maze, we could do that. We *invented* the rules.</h2>
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 50px;">But for the real world?</h2>
    <ul style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 40px; text-align: left; margin-left: 5%; line-height: 1.8;">
        <li class="fragment fade-in">Walking robots don't know exact friction physics.</li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in">Self-driving cars don't know pedestrian behavior probabilities.</li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in">Trading bots <mark>definitely</mark> don't have perfect market models.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide serves as a powerful summary for the first catch, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The phrase "demanding the universe hands you its source code" is a memorable and impactful way to conclude this section before transitioning to the second catch. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Demanding a perfect model is like demanding the universe hands you its <mark>source code</mark>.</h1>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text" style="color: #ff6b6b;">It's impossible.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide serves as a transition to the second catch, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It creates a narrative flow by pretending to solve the first problem, which leads directly into revealing the second, even more insurmountable one. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">But okay. Let's pretend we do. Let's pretend some oracle gave us the perfect model.</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">We're still not out of the woods.</h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">Because then we hit the second catch. The one that breaks computers.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide introduces the second major limitation, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The title is a well-known term in computer science, and presenting it this way gives it a sense of importance and prepares the audience for the explanation of exponential growth. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text" style="color: #ff6b6b;">Catch #2:</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">The Curse of Dimensionality</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide sets up the problem of scale, this is an EDUCATIONAL slide. It reminds the audience of the core mechanism of the algorithms—sweeping through states—and then contrasts the simplicity of the 2x2 maze with the complexity of real problems. -->
<section>
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em;">Let's look back at our algorithms. What did they have in common?</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">They both required us to <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">sweep through every single state</mark> in the environment.</h1>
    <div class="fragment fade-in" style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 50px;">
        <p>For our maze, that was easy. We had two non-terminal states, A and B.</p>
        <p>A sweep was trivial.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide dramatically illustrates the explosion of the state space, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It uses a three-part reveal to show the exponential growth from a manageable number (Tic-Tac-Toe) to a cosmically large one (Go), making the concept of dimensionality visceral. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">Now let's scale up.</h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text"><mark style="color: #4CAF50;">Tic-Tac-Toe:</mark> A few thousand unique board positions. Manageable.</h2>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text"><mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">Chess:</mark> An estimated `10^47` possible board positions.</h2>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text"><mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">Go:</mark> Over `10^170` possible board positions.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide uses a powerful analogy to give context to the number `10^170`, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The comparison to the number of atoms in the universe is a classic, highly effective way to make an unimaginably large number feel real and shocking. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">Let me put that number in perspective for you.</h2>
    <h1 style="font-size: 8em; color: #ff6b6b;">10<sup>170</sup></h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">That is more possible states on a Go board than there are <mark>atoms in the known universe</mark>.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide drives home the consequence of the massive state space, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It uses vivid imagery ("computer the size of a galaxy") to explain that even with impossible computing power, the task is still hopeless, cementing the idea of computational impossibility. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">Now, imagine trying to run Value Iteration on that.</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">Even with a galaxy-sized computer updating trillions of states per nanosecond...</h1>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">...it would not complete a single sweep before the <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">heat death of the universe</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide delivers the final, definitive statement on the second catch, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The contrast between "hard" and "physically, cosmically impossible" is powerful and leaves no room for doubt about the severity of this limitation. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">It is not just hard.</h1>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text" style="color: #ff6b6b;">It is physically, cosmically impossible.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide summarizes the two catches in a clear, concise format, this is a dense EDUCATIONAL slide. Using a numbered list with red highlighting for the key problems ("perfect map," "number of states") provides a clean, memorable summary of the chapter's core technical points. -->
<section data-background-color="#1a1a1a">
    <h2 style="color: #ff6b6b;">The Sobering Truth</h2>
    <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 40px;">The algorithms we've mastered...</h3>

        <li class="fragment fade-in">Require sweeping <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">impossible numbers</mark> of states.</li>
    </ol>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide delivers the final verdict on the algorithms discussed so far, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The phrase "toy algorithms" is a key piece of vocabulary that frames their limitations, and "fantasy land" is a memorable metaphor for the small, fully-known worlds where they work. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">This is why they are <mark>toy algorithms</mark>.</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">Theoretical bedrock, but only work in fantasy land.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide poses the major paradox that drives the rest of the series, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It uses a two-part reveal to build the question, making the audience question how real-world successes like AlphaGo were possible given the "useless" methods they just learned about. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">This leaves us with a giant, gaping question.</h1>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text fragment fade-in">A paradox.</h1>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text" style="margin-top: 50px;">If these methods are so useless in the real world... how did they do it?</h2>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">How did DeepMind build AlphaGo?</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide begins to reveal the answer to the paradox, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It uses a sequence of short, impactful statements to create a sense of discovery, introducing the idea of model-free learning without formally naming it yet. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">They didn't have the universe's source code for the game of Go.</h1>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">And they sure as hell didn't iterate through `10^170` states.</h1>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text" style="color: #4CAF50;">They did something else.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide continues the reveal, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The contrast between needing a "map" and learning from "pure experience" is the fundamental conceptual leap that distinguishes Dynamic Programming from true Reinforcement Learning. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">They used methods that don't need a map.</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text fragment fade-in">Methods that can learn from pure experience.</h2>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text fragment fade-in">From trial and error.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide serves as a major turning point in the entire series, this is a POWER TEXT slide. Using a dark background for dramatic effect, it formally names the two worlds and highlights the transition between them. This is a critical "aha" moment for the audience. -->
<section data-background-color="#000">
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">They left the world of Dynamic Programming...</h2>
    <h1 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">...and they entered the world of <mark style="color: #4CAF50;">Reinforcement Learning</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide reframes the limitations as a positive, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The metaphor of a "signpost" is powerful and optimistic, turning the "failure" of the previous algorithms into the very reason that the more advanced field exists. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">This... right here... is where our real journey begins.</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">The limitations we just discovered aren't a failure. They are a <mark style="color: #4CAF50;">signpost</mark>.</h2>
    <h2 class="fragment fade-in r-fit-text">They point the way forward, into the unknown.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this is the final slide of the chapter and serves as a direct hook into the next one, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It uses active, engaging language ("take that leap," "assemble The Big Picture") to create a clear and compelling reason for the audience to continue to the final chapter. -->
<section>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">So before we take that leap, let's take one last look back.</h2>

</section>

<!-- END CHAPTER 12 -->

<!-- START CHAPTER 13 -->

<!-- Because this content serves as the emotional opening for the final chapter, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It immediately validates the audience's potential feeling of discouragement from the previous chapter's tough conclusions. Text analysis: "That last section was a gut punch" (32 characters) is short and impactful, perfect for r-fit-text. Highlighting "gut punch" in red emphasizes the negative feeling. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">So let's be honest.</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">That last section was a <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">gut punch</mark>.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide recaps the central paradox of the last chapter, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It uses a two-part reveal with data-auto-animate to build the contrast between the elegant theory and its flawed foundation. This first part sets up the achievement. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">We mastered these beautiful, perfect algorithms...</h2>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide completes the thought using data-auto-animate. The punchline "...only to discover they're built on a lie" is a powerful reversal. Highlighting "lie" in red drives home the central conflict of the previous chapter. -->

    <h1 class="r-fit-text">...only to discover they're built on a <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">lie</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this content specifies the two "lies" or catches from Chapter 12, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It breaks down the two impossible requirements into two separate, impactful statements, revealed sequentially with data-auto-animate to give each point its own weight. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">They require a <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">perfect map</mark> of a universe we can't possibly have...</h2>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide completes the list of impossible requirements using data-auto-animate. The phrase "more states than there are atoms in existence" is a powerful, memorable anchor for the concept of the curse of dimensionality, reinforcing the severity of the limitation. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">They require a <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">perfect map</mark> of a universe we can't possibly have...</h2>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">...and they demand we visit more states than there are <mark style="color: #ff6b6b;">atoms in existence</mark>.</h2>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide uses a powerful metaphor to summarize the limitations, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The contrast between the "flawless race car" (the algorithms) and the "tiny, imaginary track" (the limited applicability) is a very effective and memorable way to frame the problem. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">It feels like we've built a flawless race car...</h1>
    <h2 class="r-fit-text">...that only works on a tiny, imaginary track.</h2>

<!-- Because this content validates the audience's potential frustration, this is a POWER TEXT slide using frequent changes for emotional pacing. This first part acknowledges the feeling of discouragement. -->
<section data-auto-animate>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">This is the point where most people get discouraged.</h1>
</section>

<!-- This POWER TEXT slide continues the sequence with data-auto-animate, breaking down the source of the frustration into two distinct parts: the elegant theory versus the harsh reality. This step-by-step reveal mimics a thought process, making it more relatable. -->
<section data-auto-animate>

<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">But this isn't a dead end.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this slide continues the positive turn, this is a POWER TEXT slide. The phrase "This is the key" is short, impactful, and creates a sense of revelation and importance, drawing the audience in for the final synthesis of ideas. -->
<section>
    <h1 class="r-fit-text">This is the <mark style="color: #4CAF50;">key</mark>.</h1>
</section>

<!-- Because this content reframes the "failure" as a positive, this is a POWER TEXT slide. It uses a two-part reveal with a fragment to create a satisfying conceptual reversal. Highlighting "signpost" in green positions the limitations as a guide rather than an obstacle. -->
